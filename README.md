[Software Design and Architecture Course Project] Two projects were used for this application: ASP.NET Web Forms application project for the frontend and ASP.NET Web Services application project for the backend. Microsoft SQL Server was used for the initialization and creation of the application’s database with two tables. The first table holds basic user information, with the Email column being this table’s primary key and the second table’s foreign key. The second table holds a row for each blood pressure reading the user records with a DateTime column. The database was detached from the SQL Server to be located in the application’s solution for portability. In this application, the user can sign up with their information, log in, and a logged in user can update their information or submit a blood pressure reading. The user can also view a graph of all their readings plotted against their timestamp.
